## Deliverables

Build out the following methods on the `CommentsController` class (Use ES6 syntax)

+ `CommentsController.prototype.addCommentFormListener()`
  + iterates through each comment form and adds an eventlistener to trigger a function on form submit
  + function should grab the imageId + comment and create a new Comment with those arguments
  + execute the render function on that found image object to append the new comment
+ `CommentsController.prototype.render(commentObject)`
  + selects the appropriate `ul` for this comment to be added to
  + appends the new comment element to this `ul`
  + Don't try to copy the `ImagesController.render` function because that is implemented differently

Build the following on the comment class model (Use ES6 syntax)

+ `new Comment(comment, imageId)`
  + should initialize with an id, image object (findImage) and commentContent (the actual text of the comment)
  + should save new comment to Comment.all property
+ `Comment.all`
  + should return all of the comment objects in an array
  + a property of the Comment class
+ `Comment.prototype.findImage(imageId)`
  + given an `int` for an image id, returns the image object with that id
  + before return - adds current comment to image's comments property
+ `Comment.prototype.commentEl()`
  + returns a string of html
    + html has an `li` tag with an `id` field and shows the comment

**NOTE:** All of the above will be tested thoroughly, so make sure your associations are working properly!
